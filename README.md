Daffodil Bank Management System  

Abstract:
Today, banks are looking beyond the transactions to the full opportunity on how to manage their customers. [1] Accordingly, they are moving beyond managing clients as simple contacts to a whole new level of client relationship management, crafting a superior commercial client experience that gives the bank a competitive advantage and a more loyal, profitable and committed customers.[1][2] Bank Management System refers to systems that enable bank customers to access accounts and general information on bank products and services through a personal computer or other intelligent device. But most of these systems do not focus on how best to manage and keep their customer’s data more secured. The chances and threats that the sector symbolizes is no longer news to the present day banking sector.[4] No traditional bank would dare face investment analysts or new customers without a complete Banking Management strategy. The main intention behind the commencement of banking services is to provide the customers with an alternative that is more responsive and with less expensive options.[3] With options more secured, customers have more control than ever.[3] Their expectations are how safe and secured their personal information would be. They also want personal attention and highly customized products and services. Daffodil Bank Management System (DBMS) aims to provide critical information for managing the bank customers more effectively, and encourages other banks that already have similar systems to move beyond transactions to a better customer management approach .





1.1 Introduction :
The Daffodil Bank Management System (DBMS) is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project we tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks.[5] Also to enable the user’s work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional banking project.[5] The Daffodil Bank Management System (DBMS System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is developed using C language and additional simple files were used for record collection, where they act as a database . Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT, systems and product development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage a contractual relationship with your intimate customers.                                                    .
Organization need to effectively define and manage requirements to ensure they are meeting needs of the customer, while proving compliance and staying on the schedule and within budget.[6][7] The impact of a poorly expressed requirement can bring a business out of compliance or even cause injury or death.[8] Requirements definition and management is an activity that can deliver a high, fast return on investment.[8] The project analyzes the system requirements and then comes up with the helpful requirements specifications. It studies other related systems and then come up with system specifications.[9] The system is then designed in a particular accordance with specifications to satisfy the requirements. The system is designed as an effective content management system.[9] The content management system deals with data entry, validation confirm and updating whiles the interactive system deals with system interaction with the administration and users. Thus, above features of this project will save transaction time and therefore increase the efficiency of the system.                                               .

We will discuss in details in the methodology section about technical specifications and coding . 


2.0 Literature Review:
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit.[10] Banking software is enterprise software that is used by the banking industry.[10][11] Typically banking software refers to core banking software and its interfaces that allows commercial banks to connect to other modular software and to the interbank networks. [11] It can also refer to the trading software used by investment banks to access capital markets. A banking management software helps to resolve common issues , as well as it maintains the credit acquisition of a banking system avoiding other external constrains which might hamper the process radically.[11] 

Daffodil Bank Management System ( DBMS ) is a project for implicating a successful Bank Management software . Also DBMS was inspired by Online payment transection and payment handling issues. Basically we can say it is a basic prototype for a secured , complete and obvious Banking Software. Our strongest  beliefs are to name it after “Daffodil” is to be Motivated from Chairman of Daffodil group Sabur Khan sir , and also Daffodil to use our prototype for developing certain software technology in future concentrating our model.                   .

5.0 Output:
In this section we will talk about the backend of our program integrations . 

We have used file pointers in order to store our information given in our DBMS . we have used different files for authentication purposes . File pointers specifies the file under the supervision of a particular function which allows to store information and later see the record if needed . so the additional files work as database for DBMS.
 
 


5.1  User Authentication:                                                                   .

Above we saw , admin can add user and easily our DBMS records that , that is because we have an external file USER.dat . where the information is allocated . here also pointers play the major role in defining the information to the correct path according to the function                                   . 

 


 


5.1  Account Information :                                                                .                                                                                                                                                                    

Above we saw , user can create Saving or Current Saving accounts  and easily our DBMS records that , that is because we have an external file ACCOUNTS.dat . where the information is allocated . here also pointers play the major role in defining the information to the correct path according to the function . 

 

 



5.2  Transaction Information:                                                              .

Above we saw , When we deposit or withdraw funds from an account or if we transfer balance , easily our DBMS records that , that is because we have an external file TRANSECTION.dat . where the information is allocated . here also pointers play the major role in defining the information to the correct path according to the function. Also it defines from which user to which user information was passed down to.                                                         . 

 


 
















5.3  User Log :                                                           .

Above we saw , when any activity occurs , when any user performs activity , then those information is recorded according to the time period and action orientation, that is because we have an external file LOG.dat . where the information is allocated . here also pointers play the major role in defining the information to the correct path according to the function.                                      . 


Additionally we have TEMP.dat for allocating garbage memory . 

 


 







5.4 Code Specifications:
Lets see details about our implemented functions and define module activity . 

#include <stdio.h> - For standard I/O Operation.
#include <stdlib.h> - To use functions like system(); system("dos command"); - this performs the dos command given. Eg. system("del abc.txt"); - This command deletes the file abc.txt from current location of project.
#include <windows.h> - Used in making gotoxy(int, int) function.
#include <conio.h> - For getch(); getche() type of functions.
#include <time.h> - To get system date and time.
#include <math.h> - To calculate mathematical problems, used esp. in interest calculation.
We  divided our user defined functions into two parts: Minor Functions (which are used frequently to support execution of core porgram) and Major Functions (which are a part of core program).  Minor function definition from Line 12-25. Major function definitions from Line 27-40.
void gotoxy(int x,int y); - To move the cursor to x column and y row of output screen.
void _password(char buffer[]); - To input password from user so that asterik (*) is displayed for each character entered. Similar to gets(string); function.

void cls(int x1,int y1,int x2, int y2); -  To clear only certain portion of screen starting from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Notice this function has been used in date entry. When date is not in dd/mm/yyyy format, the wrong value is cleared on the screen.
void increase(char i_id[]); - To increase ID by unit value. Eg. U001 ---> U002 and AC00099 ---> AC00100. Since i_id is an array, it is passed by reference. So the input value and changed value is obtained from  same variable i_id[].
void date_input(char date[]); - To convert date in format dd/mm/yyyy (The format in which user is asked to enter date) to mm/dd/yyyy (The format in which date is stored in data file).
void date_output(char date[]); - To convert date in format mm/dd/yy to dd MMM, yyyy. Eg. 01/01/17 is 
changed to 01 Jan, 2017.
void currency(char cur[], float n); -  To convert a floating number n into currency format in accurate Number system. Eg. on execution of the statement currency(cur,123456.789); the value of cur will be "1,23,456.78".
void num2word(double n,char word[]); - To convert a floating (double) number n into word according to English Arabic Number System.
void _one(int n, char one[]); -  This function is a part of function num2word(). Simple function that stores "One " for 1, "Two " for 2, ... upto 19 in string varaible one[].
void _ten(int n,char ten[]); - This function is a part of function num2word(). Simple function that stores "Ten " for 10, "Twenty " for 20, ... upto 90 in string varaible ten[].
int date_check(char date[]); - Function to check if date is in format dd/mm/yyyy or not. Returns 0 if the format is not valid and 1 for valid format.

if(date_check(ac.dob)==0||temp1>temp2) - checks if dob format is correct, on invalid format screen is partially cleared, beep tone is produced and asked to re-enter date.
if(date_check(ac.dob)==0||temp1>temp2) - checks if dob format is correct, on invalid format screen is partially cleared, beep tone is produced and asked to re-enter date.
irate=8;  - interest rate 8% for saving a/c.
irate=4;  - interest rate 4% for current saving.
flag=1; - note that flag was initially zero. on error, its turned to 1.
(fp!=NULL) - performs every thing only when file exists i.e. only when pointer is not null.

ac.t_bal=ac.c_bal*pow((1+r/100),n1-n2); - calculation of compound interest.
 ac.interest+=ac.t_bal-ac.c_bal; - calculation and addition of interest.

(strcmp(acn,ac.ac_no)==0) { srh=ac; cnt++; } -  if a/c no matches, srh stores all values of ac                           

cnt++; - This variable counts the number of times the password is asked. Note that if cnt==3 then the program terminates after displaying error message.                                    .

key=getche(); - Reads a character entered by user andstroes in char variable key.                         . 

ch=key-48; - changes char key into integer ch eg. '1'(ascii value 49)--->49-48=1.                      .

We tried to define functions as we understood . There are lot of things may also we could not add here . As code is over 2000 lines . We tried our best to add things in order to conclude the section.                                                . 

7.Conclusion: 

7.1  Software Model Used to implement DBMS:                            .

Our Basic Idea for developing DBMS was to develop a complete secure Banking Management system as to manage works in banks , also to make it efficient for online transection as also to make it as an applicable system for payment gateway . so basically our model is a Prototype Software Model.                                  . 

Prototype Model:                                                             .

The basic idea here is that instead of freezing the requirements before a design or coding can proceed, a throwaway prototype is built to understand the requirements. This prototype is developed based on the currently known requirements. By using this prototype, the client can get an “actual feel” of the system, since the interactions with prototype can enable the client to better understand the requirements of the desired system.  Prototyping is an attractive idea for complicated and large systems for which there is no manual process or existing system to help determining the requirements [13].                              .

The prototype are usually not complete systems and many of the details are not built in the prototype. The goal is to provide a system with overall functionality.[13]

 







7.2  Shortcomings of DBMS:                                                   .

Everything can not be 100% perfect . so DBMS also has few shortcomings like . 

- Lack of Graphical User Interface.                                            . 
- Complex Coding methodology.                               . 
- Unanimous and vivid large coding.                                          . 
- User defined functions  has to enroll with description for understanding.                    



7.3  Our wish:                                                                           .

Many of us lead busy lives. Some of us are up before the crack of dawn, getting ourselves prepared so we can in turn get our families ready for the day. We rush to work, rush to get the kids to school, and at the end of the day we rush home only to brace ourselves for the next day. After a hectic day, the last thing you do not want to do is spend time waiting in line at the bank, or even the post office. That's where DBMS Model comes in. Many of the benefits using DBMS model to develop a complete Banking Software. 
1.We don't have to wait in line. 
2. We don't have to plan your day around the bank's hours. 
3. We can look at your balance whenever you want, not just when you get a statement.
There are some hidden benefits too. As a young bank customer, you're just learning how to manage your money and observe your spending patterns. 
DBMS Model  allows you to watch your money on a daily basis if you want to. By keeping close tabs on your funds, you'll always be aware of what's happening in your bank account. 
For those  experienced spenders, this option  is  far more appealing than the sudden discovery that you're broke! It's  also  helpful  to  watch  how  much  interest  you're  gathering  on  investments  and savings or what service charges you have incurred. 

Most available benefits - 
1.  DBMS Model  with key banking scheme is fast, secure, convenient and free. 
2.  Quick, simple, authenticated access to accounts via the  application. 
3.  Simply scalable to grow with changing system requirement. 
4.  Global enterprise model wide access to information.

5.  Improved data security, restricting unauthorized access. 
6 Minimize storage space.                                            .

This project is developed to nurture the needs of a user in a banking sector by embedding all the tasks of transactions taking place in a bank. Future version of this project will still be much enhanced than the current version. 
Thus DBMS is developed and executed successfully.               .
