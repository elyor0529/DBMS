Today, banks are looking beyond the transactions to the full opportunity on how to manage their customers. [1] Accordingly, they are moving beyond managing clients as simple contacts to a whole new level of client relationship management, crafting a superior commercial client experience that gives the bank a competitive advantage and a more loyal, profitable and committed customers.[1][2] Bank Management System refers to systems that enable bank customers to access accounts and general information on bank products and services through a personal computer or other intelligent device. But most of these systems do not focus on how best to manage and keep their customerâ€™s data more secured. The chances and threats that the sector symbolizes is no longer news to the present day banking sector.[4] No traditional bank would dare face investment analysts or new customers without a complete Banking Management strategy. The main intention behind the commencement of banking services is to provide the customers with an alternative that is more responsive and with less expensive options.[3] With options more secured, customers have more control than ever.[3] Their expectations are how safe and secured their personal information would be. They also want personal attention and highly customized products and services. Daffodil Bank Management System (DBMS) aims to provide critical information for managing the bank customers more effectively, and encourages other banks that already have similar systems to move beyond transactions to better customer management approach .
